# Write a method multiply(a, b) that takes in two numbers and returns their product.

# You must solve this recursively (no loops!)
# You must not use the multiplication (*) operator

def multiply(num1, num2)

# Examples
multiply(3, 5)        # => 15
multiply(5, 3)        # => 15
multiply(2, 4)        # => 8
multiply(0, 10)       # => 0
multiply(-3, -6)      # => 18
multiply(3, -6)       # => -18
multiply(-3, 6)       # => -18
